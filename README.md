Hello this is a very brief overview for interpreting my results. 

I have stored the outputs that are produced when executing lineDetect.py in the outputs folder. I saved all the images that were transformed along the way 
until the final result which can be seen in the .png files that have "houghLines" appended to them.

In the houghLines output files the final result can be found with the vertical lines drawn across the borders of the object under test.

The green lines represent all the hough lines found for the left and right border while the red lines are the final output of the averaged out line.
